Hello, welcome to the UOL-Y2P-WearableSensor project.

[![UOL-Y2P-WearableSensor](https://img.youtube.com/vi/BtlxjvaMq8Y/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/BtlxjvaMq8Y)

Frankly speaking, it is a kind of non-optical bio-logging system using inertial measurement units. You could find more details in our [blog](https://wearablesensor.blogspot.com/).

There are totally three main repos in this organization:
1. [PlatformIO](https://github.com/UOL-Y2P-WearableSensor/PlatformIO): a repo for Arduino development based on PlatformIO.
2. [browser-modeling](https://github.com/UOL-Y2P-WearableSensor/browser-modeling): a repo for front-end development based on three.js.
3. [WearableSensor_Macos](https://github.com/UOL-Y2P-WearableSensor/WearableSensor_Macos): a repo for socket server development.

The references are all in the https://wearablesensor.blogspot.com/2023/02/week-5-summary-for-whole-project.html.
